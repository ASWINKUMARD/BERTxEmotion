- Context-aware Sentiment Analysis using BERT and Hugging Face Transformers 🤖

# 🚀 Overview

- SentimentSense-BERT is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that fine-tunes a pretrained BERT model using the Hugging Face Transformers library to classify text reviews as positive 😊 or negative 😞.
  
- It demonstrates how transfer learning and contextual embeddings can help understand emotions and opinions from text effectively.

# 🧠 Tech Stack

🤗 Hugging Face Transformers – model and tokenizer

🔥 PyTorch – deep learning backend

📚 Datasets Library – IMDb dataset for training

🐍 Python 3.x – programming language

# 🧩 Model Workflow

🗂️ Load the IMDb dataset

✂️ Tokenize the text using BERT tokenizer

🏋️ Fine-tune the pretrained bert-base-uncased model

📊 Evaluate accuracy and performance

💬 Predict sentiment for new text inputs

# 💡 Key Learnings

- Learned how to fine-tune BERT for sentiment classification

- Understood contextual word embeddings

- Implemented Transformer-based architecture in NLP
